# face-classification-js

Repository for gender and emotion classification using [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/).
The original repository can be seen at [oarriaga/face_classification](https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification).
We train [MobileNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNet)
to classify gender and emotion of the face based on FER2013 and IMDB datasets.
The face tracking part is done by using [`trackingjs`](https://trackingjs.com/),
lightweight JavaScript core for computer vision.

You can see more details of analysis and examples on [tupleblog](https://tupleblog.github.io/).
